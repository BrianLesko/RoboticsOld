This is a project originally created as a midterm assignment for Robotics 7752 at Ohio State. 

Goals:
Generate a Trajectory from one end effector position to another (with a constant screw axis) 
check that the trajectory satisfies joint limits
Find the joint forces and torques needed to command the robot to follow this trajectory. No feedback control.
